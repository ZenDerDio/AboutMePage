                    <p>My story with programming started in Junior School, at that time I was in love with
                        RTS games (and I still am!) such as Medieval Total War and Warcraft III, I
                        discovered mods and wanted to create something of my own in my beloved games I
                        started with a simple scripts for maps then moved to balance and full story mods
                        with advanced events and AI modification. I noticed I really enjoy it so I decided
                        to learn programming language. I went for C++ because it seemed popular and had
                        everything I needed. During that time I learned core concepts of programming.</p>
                    <p>As time passed i got into Game Development with Unity/C# and Unreal Engine/C++, after
                        finishing few projects I wanted to try something different. That was the moment i
                        started my journey with JavaScript, CSS and HTML, i made some websites, then made a
                        simple game using javascript. Another change came soon after that, i moved into
                        Android Development with Java, made project that granted me highest
                        possible grade at university. After first year at university i decided to become
                        Software Developer, despite the fact that most companies ignored, In the end, I
                        could chose where I want to work. I choose a company that allowed me to work as
                        FullStack in Java and Angular/React.</p>
                    <p>Since i started working my skill level increased at a rate i thought was impossible.
                        During my internship, in internal Project, I was thrown against Angular which i knew
                        nothing about, but i quickly manage to learn that and became quite fluent at it,
                        that was what convinced the company to hire me after internship ended. From that
                        moment i was pursuing mastery in frontend technologies while working on
                        Angular/React projects with clients. I constantly work on my own projects and
                        educate myself so that my code may be cleaner, better and faster.</p>
